Linux Voice and MagPi issues
============================

Linux Voice
-----------

Linux Voice (<http://www.linuxvoice.com>) releases its issues for free when
they are 9 months old.
The free issues are listed here: <http://www.linuxvoice.com/creative-commons-issues/>.
Here I plan to collect the URLs of the freely available issues,
thus one can download them easily.

If you want to download the epub versions, check out the content of
the `LinuxVoice_epub/` folder.

MagPi
-----

This repo was made for Linux Voice issues, but recently I got interested
in Raspberry Pi too. I don't want to maintain one more repository, so I
will collect the MagPi issues here.
